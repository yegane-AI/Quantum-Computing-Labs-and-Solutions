        "# Super Dense Coding in Qiskit\n",
        "In this lab, you will implement the Super Dense Coding protocol using Qiskit. You'll create an entangled pair of qubits, use it to encode two classical bits of information using only one qubit, and then decode that information on the receiver’s side. This lab will help you understand how quantum entanglement can be used to send more information than classically possible, and give you hands-on experience with quantum gates, measurement, and circuit simulation. By the end, you'll be able to encode and decode different messages and see how this powerful quantum communication technique works in practice."
